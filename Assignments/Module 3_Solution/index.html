          <h2><u>Chicken</u></h2>
             A chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a kind of domesticated bird. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs.[1] They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Some breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees (if there are trees around).

             "Chicken" originally referred to chicks, not the species itself. The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).
             In the Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.[9]
             General biology and habitat

             A male chicken is called a rooster or a cock(erel). A female chicken is called a hen; a young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks.

             When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this.
             Many foods are important for the various functions in our body. Chicken specifically has many of these nutrients we need. However, chicken can also cause damage to our environment and our body. The way chicken is produced affects the way our body functions and reacts. The overconsumption of chicken leads to health risks, but the normal consumption of chicken gives us the daily vitamins and nutrients we need for our body to function correctly.
             Chicken consumption has increased nearly every year since the 1960s. Our love for this type of meat has rapidly grown and changed the health for Americans today.

             Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs.
             Because of the low cost, chicken meat (also called "chicken") is one of the most used kinds of meat in the world. Americans eat 8 billion chickens every year.[6] Some popular dishes with chicken are: Buffalo wings, butter chicken, chicken rice, chicken balls, chicken pot pie, chicken soup, fried chicken (see picture), roasted chicken and tandoori chicken
